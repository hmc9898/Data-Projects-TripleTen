# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing and evaluating classification models to predict customer churn for a fictional telecom provider. The goal was to identify patterns in customer behavior and build a model to support proactive retention strategies. The process involved data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model comparison, and interpretation.

## Objectives  
- Explore key drivers of churn behavior through visual and statistical analysis  
- Prepare and encode data for supervised learning models  
- Train and tune multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM)  
- Evaluate models using ROC AUC and F1-score metrics  
- Translate results into business-relevant insights  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn, LightGBM  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Methodology  
1. Cleaned and prepared the customer dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables  
2. Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends and correlations with churn  
3. Engineered new features and split data into training and validation sets  
4. Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM classifiers  
5. Compared model performance using ROC AUC, F1, and confusion matrices  
6. Interpreted feature importance and visualized prediction thresholds  

## Key Results  
- LightGBM achieved the highest ROC AUC and balanced precision-recall performance  
- Key predictors included tenure, contract type, and monthly charges  
- The model enables targeted retention strategies by prioritizing high-risk segments  

## Limitations & Future Work  
- Results are based on historical data and may not generalize to future patterns without retraining  
- Incorporating time-dependent behavior or customer sentiment could enhance prediction accuracy  
- Potential next steps include building a dashboard or deploying the model into a real-time system
